In this problem in HackerRank, the AbsolutePermutation function has two parameters, n and k, both of which are integers, and it returns a list of integers. 
Inside the this function, a new list called 'result' is created to store the final output. First is to check if k is equal 
to 0. If it is, it adds all numbers from 1 to n into the list and returns them. Next is to check n if it is divisible by 2 × k. If not, the function 
cannot form a valid pattern, so it adds -1 to the list and returns it. If both conditions are satisfied, the function proceeds to create a pattern 
using a loop that runs from 1 to n. Using a boolean variable called add to decide whether to add or subtract k from the current 
number. If add is true, it adds i + k to the list, but if not it adds i - k. After every group of k numbers, the value of add is 
flipped to alternate between addition and subtraction. This process continues until all numbers are processed. In the end, the function 
returns the result list, which contains a “beautiful” permutation of numbers based on the given n and k values.
