This program called Almost Sorted, checks to see if a list of numbers can be sorted by reversing or 
switching two elements. After sorting, it looks for the differences and store them in a list 
called diff. It will check again if the list is sorted and if there are no differences. It shows the swap 
positions with exactly two differences. Also if there are more than two, it determines if a sorted 
list is will reult by switching between the first and last incorrect positions. It checks all of this 
and provides appropriate instructions based on the result.
