This program in HackerRank needs to find how many numbers are “between” the two sets. A number is considered between two sets if 
it meet the two rules. First is every element in the first list divides it equally, and  the second, it divides 
every element in the second list equally. The first thing i do is to get the largest number in 
the first list A and the smallest number in the second list B. The numbers will check because no valid number 
can be larger than B or smaller than A. It then goes through every 
integer x from A to B. For each x, it checks if all numbers in the first list A can be divide by x without 
leaving a remainder. But if even one number fails this test, it will skips to the next x. And if x passed the first test, 
it will kepp and move to the second condition that will checks if x can divide every number in the second list B equally. If all of these 
divisions work perfectly with no remainder, it counts that number  and adding one to count. After checking
all numbers between A and B, it will returns the total count of numbers.
